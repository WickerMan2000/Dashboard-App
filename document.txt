To whom it may concern,

  I would like to inform you that my assignment is ready. 
  I took some initiative regarding the tasks I had to carry out. 
  The first thing I decided concerns the demonstration of the 
  "Select a user to edit" message to be displayed on the right panel. 
  Additionally, when a user is selected, I decided, instead of 
  populating the form with the props data passed from the Persons component 
  to the Person component when a user is clicked, to use an HTTP request 
  that gets the (unmutated) data from the users' resource. 
  Finally the node version I use is v18.12.0

Kind regards,

Savvas
